# geeSharpening
Pan-sharpening functions implemented in Google Earth Engine

### Currently implemented:
- Brovey (weighted)
- IHS
- Simple mean

Functions are designed for Landsat 8 TOA data, although they could be easily adapted to other platforms. An example usage can be found at the end of `sharpening.js`.
